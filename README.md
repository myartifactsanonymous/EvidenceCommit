# In Search of Evidence About Deep Learning Based Commit Message Generation

The quality of code commit messages has been shown to impact code maintainability and fault-proneness. Automating their generation using deep learning (DL) techniques has gained significant attention in recent years, leading to numerous experiments evaluating these DL approaches. This paper aims to characterize these experiments to assess the knowledge that can be obtained from them. A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted following established guidelines. Relevant papers were identified by searching major software engineering databases. Data were extracted to characterize the experiments and their results. The SLR identified 20 primary studies published between 2017 and 2023, covering 15 approaches, 8 response variables and 14 datasets. This will allow us to extract evidence from the comparison of 57 pairs of approaches. Future work includes synthesizing the reported experimental results.
